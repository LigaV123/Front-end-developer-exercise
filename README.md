# Front-end developer
## Personal overview
I wrote this project in Typescript and React.js.
I did not implement the project using Next.js, because I have not used that framework.

I implemented some pagination, probably could have made some more components like product list, so the main app file would look cleaner.

For styling I used the "tailwindcss" library. The main challenge using this library was making all pages with responsive designs, 
I probably could have made some more adjustments to that like smaller header and more compact the rest of the context.

I did not manage to implement unit tests with @testing-library/react, because I have not worked with that library.

With more given time I could have made some more adjustments in the overall project.

## Exercise
### The aim:
Get a general overview of React.js;

### Main task:
* Create a product list page
  - Products should be fetched using the endpoint https://run.mocky.io/v3/b54fe93f-f5a1-426b-a76c-e43d246901fd
  - The page should have a search input that filters products without page refresh
  - Search should be performed once the user stops writing
  - Each product should display: name, price and category
  - Clicking on a product should redirect to product details page
* Product details page
  - It should display product: name, price, category and description

### Requirements:
* Project should be written in Typescript and React.js
* All pages should have responsive designs - looking good both on desktop and mobile

### Bonus points:
* For styling preferably use the "tailwindcss" or "styled-components" library
* Implement the project using Next.js
* Implement pagination
* Unit tests with @testing-library/react

### Notes:
Some requirement points can be skipped if you feel like they are too complex at the time. 
Focus first on business requirements, designs afterwards. Please provide a comment in the code about what has been skipped.

** Important **

It is ok to re-use parts of code from other sources. But it is important to understand it and to be able to explain what it does, as well as to attribute the original author.
